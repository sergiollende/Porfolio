      My name is Sergio Llenderrozos, but my friends call me Llende. I began my
      programming journey at the age of 16, creating my first application using
      Python. Currently, I specialize in
      <strong>developing custom software solutions.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      Among my notable achievements is the successful migration of client
      applications from monolithic architectures to microservices and
      development of custom software solutions.

      As a software engineer, <strong
        >I possess extensive experience with a wide range of modern languages
        and frameworks, with a particular focus on<em class="italic">
          C# and .NET</em
        ></strong
      >. My objective is to continually enhance my programming skills and
      professional expertise.
